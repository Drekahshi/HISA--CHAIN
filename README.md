> ## 📊 Outlook: Africa 2025, Inflation & Conservation Finance

### 🌍 Africa’s Economic Outlook 2025
- Growth projected at **3.9%** (up from 3.3% in 2024).  
- East Africa leads at **5.9% growth**, driven by Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Kenya.  
- Key risks: inflationary pressures, debt averaging **60%+ of GDP**, and **USD 587 billion** lost annually through financial leakages.  
- AfCFTA and domestic resource mobilization could unlock **USD 1.43 trillion**, strengthening sustainable growth.  

---

### 💱 UMOJA: Tackling Inflation with Stability
- Inflation remains a top challenge across Africa in 2025.  
- UMOJA provides a **nature-backed and tokenized financial layer** to hedge against inflationary shocks.  
- By anchoring assets in **real value (commodities, tokenized securities, green bonds)**, UMOJA helps protect households and SMEs from currency erosion.  
- Supports Africa’s broader macroeconomic need for **stable, predictable, and inclusive financial tools**.  

---

### 🌱 JANI: Conservation as an Economic Engine
- Kenya’s banking sector has already allocated **KSh 250 billion** (≈15% of its portfolio) to nature-positive ventures, with a target of **30% by 2030**.  
- The opportunity is vast: **over KSh 19 trillion (~USD 130 billion)** in untapped investments across agriculture, forestry, and environmental services.  
- **If Africa could tap just 1% of this annually (~KSh 190 billion / USD 1.3 billion), it would generate significant capital for conservation, rural livelihoods, and climate resilience.**  
- JANI leverages **agentic AI + tokenization** to channel capital into conservation, turning idle/degraded land into productive ecological assets.  
- Directly aligns with **Kenya’s banking green growth strategy** and Africa’s **USD 194 billion annual sustainable finance gap**.  

---

### 🪙 HISA’s Position
Together, UMOJA and JANI embody the **dual financial response** Africa needs:  
- **Stability against inflation (UMOJA)**  
- **Conservation-driven growth (JANI)**  

Even capturing **1% of Africa’s idle and nature-positive opportunity each year** could close billions in financing gaps, proving the viability of a **green dividend model**.  

HISA positions itself as a **continental blueprint**, bridging finance and sustainability while unlocking Africa’s **green dividend** for inclusive and intergenerational prosperity.

## 🎭 Culture as Capital: *Preserving and Valuing African Heritage*

> Culture is not just memory—it's economy.

- 💰 Tokenize traditional stories, crafts, and practices  
- 🔐 Protect indigenous IP  
- 🌍 Build a digital archive  
- 🧓 Reward elders and knowledge holders

🎨 Cultural preservation becomes a **livelihood**, not just legacy.

---
## Governance: Blending Tech + Tradition

Our governance model fuses cutting-edge blockchain mechanics with time-tested African traditions of consensus-building.

- 🛡️ **Multi-Sig + Community Voting**  
  Protocol upgrades and treasury decisions require both validator consensus (multi-sig) and open community voting. This prevents unilateral control while encouraging transparency.

- 🧓 **Elder Councils for Cultural Stewardship**  
  Inspired by traditional African councils of elders, cultural and ethical questions are resolved by respected community representatives. This preserves heritage while ensuring trust in social decisions.

- 🗳️ **Hybrid Governance = Innovation + Integrity**  
  The system balances the speed and efficiency of decentralized tech with the wisdom and legitimacy of tradition. This “two-legged” model protects against capture while grounding the ecosystem in African identity.

## 🌐 The W.L. Gore Lattice Model in HISA

We adapt the **W.L. Gore lattice model**—a flat, non-hierarchical system where leadership emerges from expertise—for decentralized governance in the HISA ecosystem.

- **No Central Bosses**: Validators self-organize around initiatives, much like Gore’s associates rally around projects.  
- **Peer Accountability**: Influence comes from contribution and reliability, not titles.  
- **Dynamic Leadership**: For each decision—whether in **Umoja (prosperity + inflation solutions)**, **JANI (conservation validators)**, or **CHAT (cultural heritage)**—leaders emerge naturally from the most engaged and knowledgeable validators.  
- **Collaboration at Scale**: Just as Gore fostered innovation without rigid hierarchies, HISA ensures validators and communities can innovate across Africa’s most urgent challenges without bottlenecks.  

👉 By merging the **lattice model** with **African consensus traditions**, HISA’s DAO achieves both **scalability** and **authenticity**: a validator ecosystem that grows with innovation while staying rooted in community trust.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js; version 6.0.0 or higher recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A Hedera testnet account (free from [portal.hedera.com](https://portal.hedera.com)) for blockchain interactions
- Optional: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing, or a browser for the web interface

Ensure your system has at least 4GB of RAM and a stable internet connection (for Hedera network access).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone, set up, and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd HISA
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   All required packages, including the Hedera SDK (`@hashgraph/sdk`), are listed in `package.json`. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   > _Note: If `@hashgraph/sdk` isn't installed automatically or you need a specific version, run `npm install @hashgraph/sdk` explicitly._
   >
   > _If using Yarn: `yarn install`. This may take a few minutes._

3. **Configure Hedera and Environment:**
   HISA uses Hedera for smart contracts, token management (e.g., UMOJA for inflation hedging, JANI for conservation), and verification (e.g., AVL for AI/community consensus).
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory.
   - Edit `.env` with your Hedera credentials (do NOT commit this file to Git):
     ```
     HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet  # or 'mainnet' for production
     MY_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.123456  # Your Hedera account ID
     MY_PRIVATE_KEY=302e0201...  # Your Ed25519 private key (keep secure!)
     # Add other vars if needed, e.g., API keys for AI services or databases
     ```
   - For testing: Use Hedera testnet (free HBAR faucet available). Check network status at [status.hedera.com](https://status.hedera.com).
   - If your setup involves databases (e.g., conservation or cultural DBs), install and configure them here (e.g., MongoDB: `npm install mongoose` if not already in dependencies).

   ### Hedera Integrations and APIs
   HISA leverages Hedera's ecosystem for real-time webhooks, APIs, and third-party tools to enable features like AI-driven verification, conservation tokenization, and SDG-aligned metrics. Below are setup instructions for key integrations used in the project. These are configured via the Hedera SDK and may require additional API keys—add them to your `.env` file.

   - **Hedera Webhooks:** Used for real-time notifications (e.g., transaction confirmations, token minting events for JANI or UMOJA). 
     - Setup: Install any webhook handlers if not in dependencies (e.g., `npm install express` for a local server). Configure in code (e.g., `/src/hedera/webhooks.js`).
     - Local Testing: Run a mock webhook server: `node src/hedera/webhook-server.js`. Simulate events via Hedera Mirror Node API (add `MIRROR_NODE_URL=https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com` to `.env`).
     - Docs: [Hedera Mirror Node Webhooks](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/webhooks).

   - **Dovu:** Integrates for carbon credits and environmental data tokenization (e.g., for JANI conservation engine).
     - Setup: Add Dovu API key to `.env` (e.g., `DOVU_API_KEY=your_key_here`). Ensure `@dovu/sdk` or similar is installed via `npm install`.
     - Local Testing: Trigger a mock carbon offset: `node src/integrations/dovu-test.js`. Verify via console logs or Hedera explorer.

   - **Guardian:** For ESG reporting and tokenized securities (e.g., aligning with UMOJA's stability features).
     - Setup: Add Guardian credentials to `.env` (e.g., `GUARDIAN_API_URL=https://api.guardian.example`, `GUARDIAN_TOKEN=your_token`).
     - Local Testing: Run `npm run test-guardian` to simulate ESG data submission. Check for Hedera transaction IDs in output.
     - Docs: [Guardian on Hedera](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/guardian).

   - **Kabila:** Hedera-based platform for African community projects (e.g., cultural databases and governance).
     - Setup: Configure Kabila endpoint in `.env` (e.g., `KABILA_API= https://api.kabila.io`, `KABILA_KEY=your_key`).
     - Local Testing: Test community consensus flows: `node src/integrations/kabila-verify.js`. Integrates with AVL for redundancy.

   - **Hedera AI Studio ADK:** AI development kit for agentic AI features (e.g., verification in AVL, culture-aware automation).
     - Setup: Install if needed (`npm install @hedera/ai-studio-adk`). Add API key to `.env` (e.g., `HEDERA_AI_STUDIO_KEY=your_key`).
     - Local Testing: Run AI models locally: `npm run ai-studio-test`. Simulate SDG actions (e.g., tree planting verification).
     - Docs: [Hedera AI Studio](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/ai-studio).

   - **Eliza Plugins:** Custom plugins for chatbot/AI interactions (e.g., for mental health support or cultural storytelling in telemedicine).
     - Setup: Add plugin configs to `.env` (e.g., `ELIZA_PLUGIN_ENDPOINT=https://eliza.example`, `ELIZA_API_KEY=your_key`).
     - Local Testing: Start plugin server: `node src/plugins/eliza.js`. Test via browser console or API calls for voice/SMS interfaces.

   - **OpenCovAI:** Open-source AI for coverage/verification (e.g., health outcomes tracking, biodiversity via satellite AI).
     - Setup: Install dependencies if needed (`npm install opencovai-sdk`). Configure in `.env` (e.g., `OPENCOVAI_MODEL=health-verifier`, `OPENCOVAI_KEY=your_key`).
     - Local Testing: Run verification scripts: `node src/integrations/opencovai-test.js`. Integrates with ZK-proofs for privacy.

   **Note:** All integrations use Hedera's Consensus Service (HCS) or Token Service (HTS) for immutable records. For local dev, use testnet to avoid costs. If APIs require sign-up, get keys from their respective docs.

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   > _Alternative: `npm run dev` if using tools like Vite or Next.js. The console will show when it's ready (e.g., "Server running on http://localhost:3000")._

5. **View and test locally:**
   - Open a browser and go to: http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown in the console).
   - For feature phone simulation: Test USSD/SMS interfaces via console logs or emulators (details in `/docs` if available).
   - Interact with Hedera features: Trigger actions like token minting or verifications—monitor transactions on [Hedera Explorer](https://hashscan.io/testnet).

The app should now be running locally, allowing you to test SDG-aligned features like tokenized actions, cultural archiving, or conservation tracking.

## Usage

- **Web Interface:** Navigate to http://localhost:3000. Log in with demo credentials (e.g., username: 'admin', password: 'password'—update with your actual demos).
- **Hedera Interactions:** Use the dashboard to simulate actions (e.g., plant a tree → mint JANI token). View on testnet explorer.
- **API Testing:** Send requests to endpoints like http://localhost:3000/api/tokenize (use Postman). For example:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/verify-action -d '{"action": "plant_tree"}'
  ```
- **Inclusive Access Testing:** For feature phones, check SMS/USSD mocks in code (e.g., `/src/inclusive-access`).
- **Integration Testing:** Test webhooks by simulating events; use Postman for Dovu/Guardian APIs; run AI scripts for Hedera AI Studio or OpenCovAI.
- Refer to the SDG impact table in the project overview for metrics (e.g., verified via smart contracts).

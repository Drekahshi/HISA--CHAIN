It entails

- 🌳 *conservation database*
- 🧠 *Telemedicine and economic inclusion and empowerment*
- 🪢 *Cultural database*

This isn't just crypto. **It's a people-powered digital economy** that works on **any device**, even basic feature phones.

> **"HISA" means  Ownership**  in swahili
> Giving Africans control over their data, culture, and financial future. We are solving real problems that people suffer through, achieving alleviation and elevation for all through Web3 onboarding, thanks to Hedera's accessible, enterprise-grade distributed technologies.
>
> ## 📊 Outlook: Africa 2025, Inflation & Conservation Finance

### 🌍 Africa’s Economic Outlook 2025
- Growth projected at **3.9%** (up from 3.3% in 2024).  
- East Africa leads at **5.9% growth**, driven by Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Kenya.  
- Key risks: inflationary pressures, debt averaging **60%+ of GDP**, and **USD 587 billion** lost annually through financial leakages.  
- AfCFTA and domestic resource mobilization could unlock **USD 1.43 trillion**, strengthening sustainable growth.  

---

### 💱 UMOJA: Tackling Inflation with Stability
- Inflation remains a top challenge across Africa in 2025.  
- UMOJA provides a **nature-backed and tokenized financial layer** to hedge against inflationary shocks.  
- By anchoring assets in **real value (commodities, tokenized securities, green bonds)**, UMOJA helps protect households and SMEs from currency erosion.  
- Supports Africa’s broader macroeconomic need for **stable, predictable, and inclusive financial tools**.  

---

### 🌱 JANI: Conservation as an Economic Engine
- Kenya’s banking sector has already allocated **KSh 250 billion** (≈15% of its portfolio) to nature-positive ventures, with a target of **30% by 2030**.  
- The opportunity is vast: **over KSh 19 trillion (~USD 130 billion)** in untapped investments across agriculture, forestry, and environmental services.  
- **If Africa could tap just 1% of this annually (~KSh 190 billion / USD 1.3 billion), it would generate significant capital for conservation, rural livelihoods, and climate resilience.**  
- JANI leverages **agentic AI + tokenization** to channel capital into conservation, turning idle/degraded land into productive ecological assets.  
- Directly aligns with **Kenya’s banking green growth strategy** and Africa’s **USD 194 billion annual sustainable finance gap**.  

---

### 🪙 HISA’s Position
Together, UMOJA and JANI embody the **dual financial response** Africa needs:  
- **Stability against inflation (UMOJA)**  
- **Conservation-driven growth (JANI)**  

Even capturing **1% of Africa’s idle and nature-positive opportunity each year** could close billions in financing gaps, proving the viability of a **green dividend model**.  

HISA positions itself as a **continental blueprint**, bridging finance and sustainability while unlocking Africa’s **green dividend** for inclusive and intergenerational prosperity.

---

## 🔑 Core Philosophy: *Ownership Through Action*

> Everyday actions = Economic value.

- 📖 Share traditional stories  
- 🌿 Plant trees  
- 🧘 Support mental health  
- 🛠️ Manage resources

🧩 These become **verified digital actions** using agentic AI and Hedera smart contracts.

## 🎭 Culture as Capital: *Preserving and Valuing African Heritage*

> Culture is not just memory—it's economy.

- 💰 Tokenize traditional stories, crafts, and practices  
- 🔐 Protect indigenous IP  
- 🌍 Build a digital archive  
- 🧓 Reward elders and knowledge holders

🎨 Cultural preservation becomes a **livelihood**, not just legacy.

---
## Governance: Blending Tech + Tradition

Our governance model fuses cutting-edge blockchain mechanics with time-tested African traditions of consensus-building.

- 🛡️ **Multi-Sig + Community Voting**  
  Protocol upgrades and treasury decisions require both validator consensus (multi-sig) and open community voting. This prevents unilateral control while encouraging transparency.

- 🧓 **Elder Councils for Cultural Stewardship**  
  Inspired by traditional African councils of elders, cultural and ethical questions are resolved by respected community representatives. This preserves heritage while ensuring trust in social decisions.

- 🗳️ **Hybrid Governance = Innovation + Integrity**  
  The system balances the speed and efficiency of decentralized tech with the wisdom and legitimacy of tradition. This “two-legged” model protects against capture while grounding the ecosystem in African identity.

---

## 🌐 The W.L. Gore Lattice Model in HISA

We adapt the **W.L. Gore lattice model**—a flat, non-hierarchical system where leadership emerges from expertise—for decentralized governance in the HISA ecosystem.

- **No Central Bosses**: Validators self-organize around initiatives, much like Gore’s associates rally around projects.  
- **Peer Accountability**: Influence comes from contribution and reliability, not titles.  
- **Dynamic Leadership**: For each decision—whether in **Umoja (prosperity + inflation solutions)**, **JANI (conservation validators)**, or **CHAT (cultural heritage)**—leaders emerge naturally from the most engaged and knowledgeable validators.  
- **Collaboration at Scale**: Just as Gore fostered innovation without rigid hierarchies, HISA ensures validators and communities can innovate across Africa’s most urgent challenges without bottlenecks.  

👉 By merging the **lattice model** with **African consensus traditions**, HISA’s DAO achieves both **scalability** and **authenticity**: a validator ecosystem that grows with innovation while staying rooted in community trust.

## Prerequisites https://hisa-chain-dapp.vercel.app/

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js; version 6.0.0 or higher recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A Hedera testnet account (free from [portal.hedera.com](https://portal.hedera.com)) for blockchain interactions
- Optional: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing, or a browser for the web interface

Ensure your system has at least 4GB of RAM and a stable internet connection (for Hedera network access).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone, set up, and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Drekahshi/HISA--CHAIN.git
   cd HISA
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   All required packages, including the Hedera SDK (`@hashgraph/sdk`), are listed in `package.json`. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   > _Note: If `@hashgraph/sdk` isn't installed automatically or you need a specific version, run `npm install @hashgraph/sdk` explicitly._
   >
   > _If using Yarn: `yarn install`. This may take a few minutes._

3. **Configure Hedera and Environment:**
   HISA uses Hedera for smart contracts, token management (e.g., UMOJA for inflation hedging, JANI for conservation), and verification (e.g., AVL for AI/community consensus).
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory.
   - Edit `.env` with your Hedera credentials (do NOT commit this file to Git):
     ```
     HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet  # or 'mainnet' for production
     MY_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.123456  # Your Hedera account ID
     MY_PRIVATE_KEY=302e0201...  # Your Ed25519 private key (keep secure!)
     # Add other vars if needed, e.g., API keys for AI services or databases
     ```
   - For testing: Use Hedera testnet (free HBAR faucet available). Check network status at [status.hedera.com](https://status.hedera.com).
   - If your setup involves databases (e.g., conservation or cultural DBs), install and configure them here (e.g., MongoDB: `npm install mongoose` if not already in dependencies).

   ### Hedera Integrations and APIs
   HISA leverages Hedera's ecosystem for real-time webhooks, APIs, and third-party tools to enable features like AI-driven verification, conservation tokenization, and SDG-aligned metrics. Below are setup instructions for key integrations used in the project. These are configured via the Hedera SDK and may require additional API keys—add them to your `.env` file.

   - **Hedera Webhooks:** Used for real-time notifications (e.g., transaction confirmations, token minting events for JANI or UMOJA). 
     - Setup: Install any webhook handlers if not in dependencies (e.g., `npm install express` for a local server). Configure in code (e.g., `/src/hedera/webhooks.js`).
     - Local Testing: Run a mock webhook server: `node src/hedera/webhook-server.js`. Simulate events via Hedera Mirror Node API (add `MIRROR_NODE_URL=https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com` to `.env`).
     - Docs: [Hedera Mirror Node Webhooks](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/webhooks).

   - **Dovu:** Integrates for carbon credits and environmental data tokenization (e.g., for JANI conservation engine).
     - Setup: Add Dovu API key to `.env` (e.g., `DOVU_API_KEY=your_key_here`). Ensure `@dovu/sdk` or similar is installed via `npm install`.
     - Local Testing: Trigger a mock carbon offset: `node src/integrations/dovu-test.js`. Verify via console logs or Hedera explorer.

   - **Guardian:** For ESG reporting and tokenized securities (e.g., aligning with UMOJA's stability features).
     - Setup: Add Guardian credentials to `.env` (e.g., `GUARDIAN_API_URL=https://api.guardian.example`, `GUARDIAN_TOKEN=your_token`).
     - Local Testing: Run `npm run test-guardian` to simulate ESG data submission. Check for Hedera transaction IDs in output.
     - Docs: [Guardian on Hedera](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/guardian).

   - **Kabila:** Hedera-based platform for African community projects (e.g., cultural databases and governance).
     - Setup: Configure Kabila endpoint in `.env` (e.g., `KABILA_API= https://api.kabila.io`, `KABILA_KEY=your_key`).
     - Local Testing: Test community consensus flows: `node src/integrations/kabila-verify.js`. Integrates with AVL for redundancy.

   - **Hedera AI Studio ADK:** AI development kit for agentic AI features (e.g., verification in AVL, culture-aware automation).
     - Setup: Install if needed (`npm install @hedera/ai-studio-adk`). Add API key to `.env` (e.g., `HEDERA_AI_STUDIO_KEY=your_key`).
     - Local Testing: Run AI models locally: `npm run ai-studio-test`. Simulate SDG actions (e.g., tree planting verification).
     - Docs: [Hedera AI Studio](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/ai-studio).

   - **Eliza Plugins:** Custom plugins for chatbot/AI interactions (e.g., for mental health support or cultural storytelling in telemedicine).
     - Setup: Add plugin configs to `.env` (e.g., `ELIZA_PLUGIN_ENDPOINT=https://eliza.example`, `ELIZA_API_KEY=your_key`).
     - Local Testing: Start plugin server: `node src/plugins/eliza.js`. Test via browser console or API calls for voice/SMS interfaces.

   - **OpenCovAI:** Open-source AI for coverage/verification (e.g., health outcomes tracking, biodiversity via satellite AI).
     - Setup: Install dependencies if needed (`npm install opencovai-sdk`). Configure in `.env` (e.g., `OPENCOVAI_MODEL=health-verifier`, `OPENCOVAI_KEY=your_key`).
     - Local Testing: Run verification scripts: `node src/integrations/opencovai-test.js`. Integrates with ZK-proofs for privacy.

   **Note:** All integrations use Hedera's Consensus Service (HCS) or Token Service (HTS) for immutable records. For local dev, use testnet to avoid costs. If APIs require sign-up, get keys from their respective docs.

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   > _Alternative: `npm run dev` if using tools like Vite or Next.js. The console will show when it's ready (e.g., "Server running on http://localhost:3000")._

5. **View and test locally:**
   - Open a browser and go to: http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown in the console).
   - For feature phone simulation: Test USSD/SMS interfaces via console logs or emulators (details in `/docs` if available).
   - Interact with Hedera features: Trigger actions like token minting or verifications—monitor transactions on [Hedera Explorer](https://hashscan.io/testnet).

The app should now be running locally, allowing you to test SDG-aligned features like tokenized actions, cultural archiving, or conservation tracking.

## Usage

- **Web Interface:** Navigate to http://localhost:3000. Log in with demo credentials (e.g., username: 'admin', password: 'password'—update with your actual demos).
- **Hedera Interactions:** Use the dashboard to simulate actions (e.g., plant a tree → mint JANI token). View on testnet explorer.
- **API Testing:** Send requests to endpoints like http://localhost:3000/api/tokenize (use Postman). For example:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/verify-action -d '{"action": "plant_tree"}'
  ```
- **Inclusive Access Testing:** For feature phones, check SMS/USSD mocks in code (e.g., `/src/inclusive-access`).
- **Integration Testing:** Test webhooks by simulating events; use Postman for Dovu/Guardian APIs; run AI scripts for Hedera AI Studio or OpenCovAI.
- Refer to the SDG impact table in the project overview for metrics (e.g., verified via smart contracts).
